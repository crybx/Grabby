// Currently it's minimal but can be expanded as settings needs grow

    // You could add event listeners for settings changes here
    // For example, if you add toggle switches or other settings controls

    // For demonstration, we'll just log when the settings panel is opened

    // You could also fetch and display current settings values here
    // For example, if you implement custom keyboard shortcuts or other options
